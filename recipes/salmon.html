        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Smoked salmon is a preparation of salmon, and due to its high price, it is 
            considered a delicacy. When it came to offerings to Odin, it is believed that
            the offering of smoked salmon is acceptable as well if mead and wine aren't 
            readily available to the offerer.
